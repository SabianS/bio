          <h3>Under Pressure</h3>
          <p> Logic sought to create an album that would stand out as "beautiful, musical and melodic" while also including "raw lyricism." In order to establish his desired sound, his lyricism is heavily introspective, analyzing himself by exploring his ambivalent outlook on his newfound fame, his family, feelings of self-consciousness, success, and his struggles with addiction. His goal was to provide an autobiography which explicitly detailed the scenarios and experiences that impacted him during his rise in the music industry.</p>

          <h3>The Incredible True Story</h3>
          <p>The Incredible True Story has been characterized as an experimental musical work, with particular attention drawn to the running storyline detailed within the album.[4] It incorporates elements inspired by filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, including its non-linear storytelling, the satirical subject matter discussed between the characters, and its introduction of 20th century score pieces typically seen deployed by Tarantino.[5] Logic translated the storyline sonically by introducing scenes within the album, as well as offcuts within songs to help establish plot and context</p>
